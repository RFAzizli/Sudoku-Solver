# Sudoku-Solver

The name of the repo says for itself, but I will elaborate.

This is a sudoku solver, as simple as it is. All you need to do, is write down a file, and then put the path to it in the SudokuSolver main method, replace "Sample1.txt" with the path you have.

This sudoku solver works via recursive-backtracking, so it can even go with an empty field.

Just in case,
If you put a wrong field, i.e. it has two same numbers on the same row, col, subgrid, it will throw an Exception.

P.S. 
I added 3 sample files, two normal ones and one with no solution, you can check it yourself if you want.
